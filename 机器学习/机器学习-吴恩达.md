### definition

> Field of study  that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
>
> 在没有明确设置的情况下,使计算机具有学习能力的研究领域.

> Well-posed Learning Problem : 
>
> 一个适当的学习问题定义如下:
>
> A computer programe is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
>
> 计算机程序充经验E中学习, 解决某一任务T, 进行某一性能度量 P, 通过P测定在T上的表现因经验E而提高



### use Scenarious

+ when humen cannot program the system manually
  - navigating on Mars
+ when humen cannot define the solution easily
  - speech/visual recognition
+ when needing rapid decisions that humans cannot do
  - high-frequency trading
+ when needing to be user-oriented in a massive scale
  - consumer-targeted marketing



### key Essence of ML

1. exists some =='underlying pattern'== (潜在模式)to be learned -- so 'performance measure' can be improved
2. but no programmable (easy) definition -- so 'ML' is needed
3. somehow there is data about the pattern -- so ML has some 'inputs' to learn from.
